# BCC University

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️
```
Submissions from 2022 students will have much higher priority than submissions from 2021, SAP, or higher students.
Please take note of this before planning to attempt this freepass challenge.
```
## :love_letter: Invitation Letter

In this digital age, transparency and management of information is greatly needed, especially in the field of education. At some point, there is an investor who establishes a university, while the university requires a system for managing information from its students.

This application is intended for university students to be able to access information provided by the university. To accomplish this quickly, BCC will need help. By this letter, we humbly invite you to join us on this journey to figure out the best solution. We cannot wait to see your ideas to overcome this problem.

## :family: Entities and Actors

We want to see your perspective about these problems. You can define various types of entities or actors. One thing for sure, there is no true or false statement to define the entities. As long as the results are understandable, then go for it! :rocket:

3. Finish all service implementations
4. Write the installation guide of your backend service in the section below

## :test_tube: API Installation
This API is made using laravel framework. To use this API you need this laravel program running on your local service.

Follow these steps to run laravel program
1. Clone this repository
2. Run composer install to install the required PHP dependencies
3. Copy the .env.example file to .env and edit the database credentials according to your database server
