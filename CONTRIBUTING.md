# Contributing Guideline

Here's how to submit a Pull Request (PR):

1. [Fork this repository on GitHub][fork] then do the following:
    * Setup an [Upstream remote][configure-upstream] to this repository
      `https://github.com/bccfilkom-be/freepass-2023`.
    * [Sync your fork][sync-fork] with the upstream.
2. Clone your fork of the repository to your local computer.
3. Create a branch with a descriptive name to work (i.e., `git checkout -b your-name`).
4. Make changes, commit them, and push the branch to your repository fork.
5. [Submit a pull request][pull-req] to the master branch.
6. Please leave us your full name, NIM, and WhatsApp number on the pull request, fill [registration-form], and we will contact you for further information. Take note of this if you're planning to use a pseudonymous GitHub account, as your real identity would have to be included in the pull request.
